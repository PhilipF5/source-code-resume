# Source Code Resume

A fun, developer-themed resume built with React and TypeScript. The data is loaded from JSON and then parsed by an engine to resemble source code syntax. Color scheme is based on [One Monokai Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai) for Visual Studio Code.
